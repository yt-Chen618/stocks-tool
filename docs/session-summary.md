# Session Summary

Last updated: 2026-05-22

## Project

- Name: `stocks-tool`
- Workspace: `C:\Users\dell\OneDrive - Duke University\桌面\stocks-tool`

## Current State

### Backend and database

- FastAPI application code is runnable.
- PostgreSQL is expected via Docker Compose for local development.
- Alembic initial migration is applied.
- Local startup command:

```powershell
uvicorn --app-dir src stocks_tool.main:app --reload
```

### Active API surfaces

- `watchlists`
- `broker-accounts`
- `account-snapshots`
- `brokers/longbridge`
- `executions`
- `orders`

### Longbridge integration

- Longbridge paper account is connected.
- `.env` already contains:
  - `LONGBRIDGE_APP_KEY`
  - `LONGBRIDGE_APP_SECRET`
  - `LONGBRIDGE_PAPER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `LONGBRIDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is still empty.
- Local paper account id is aligned to the real paper account number:
  - `LBPT10087357`

### Implemented Longbridge capabilities

- `GET /brokers/longbridge/configuration`
- `GET /brokers/longbridge/quote?symbol=...&mode=paper`
- `POST /brokers/longbridge/account-sync/{external_account_id}?mode=paper`
- `POST /orders/sync/longbridge/{external_account_id}`

### Automatic reconciliation

- A background reconciliation scheduler now starts with the FastAPI app.
- Active Longbridge paper accounts with `auto_reconcile_enabled=true` are polled automatically.
- Default intervals:
  - scheduler poll loop: `15s`
  - account snapshot sync: `300s`
  - order sync: `300s`
  - working-order sync: `60s`
- Broker-account records now persist:
  - `account_sync_status`
  - `account_last_sync_attempt_at`
  - `account_last_synced_at`
  - `account_last_sync_error`
  - `orders_sync_status`
  - `orders_last_sync_attempt_at`
  - `orders_last_synced_at`
  - `orders_last_sync_error`
- The scheduler is disabled in pytest through `tests/conftest.py`.

### Orders layer

Available endpoints:

- `GET /executions`
- `GET /orders`
- `GET /orders/{order_id}`
- `POST /orders/submit`
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/refresh`
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/replace`
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/cancel`
- `POST /orders/sync/longbridge/{external_account_id}`

Current behavior:

- Longbridge symbol format is broker-native, for example `AAPL.US` and `UNH.US`.
- `limit` and `market` orders are supported.
- `stop` orders are mapped to Longbridge `MIT` or `LIT`.
- Live trading is blocked while `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING=false`.
- Order `raw_payload` has been cleaned up and no longer stores the earlier oversized enum tree for newly refreshed or newly submitted orders.
- The dashboard frontend now exercises submit, refresh, replace, and cancel against these endpoints.
- Execution summaries are now derived from broker order-detail snapshots using `executed_quantity`, `executed_price`, and broker `updated_at`.
- Executions are persisted in the new `executions` table and exposed through `GET /executions`.

### Latest paper-account snapshot

- Manual paper-account sync was run on `2026-05-21`.
- Latest snapshot captured at: `2026-05-21T02:14:52.793714Z`
- Positions synced: `1`
- Current position summary:
  - `UNH.US`
  - Quantity: `10`
  - Market value: `$3,833.00`
  - Unrealized PnL: `-$53.50`

### Real paper-order validations already completed

1. Filled order
- Symbol: `UNH.US`
- Side: `buy`
- Quantity: `10`
- External order id: `1241720324853071872`
- Local order id: `cd3d12ba-944e-4e93-84d9-56f89e6a4327`
- Status: `filled`

2. Earlier submit -> replace -> cancel validation order
- Symbol: `UNH.US`
- Side: `buy`
- Quantity: `1`
- External order id: `1241723840942329856`
- Local order id: `d54e2052-02cf-4637-aaed-c83620eb22be`
- Final status: `canceled`

3. Real dashboard regression completed on `2026-05-21`
- Symbol: `UNH.US`
- Side: `buy`
- Submitted quantity / price: `1 @ 320.00`
- Replaced quantity / price: `2 @ 321.00`
- External order id: `1241940481017913344`
- Local order id: `9973705e-0f19-4a45-8abd-fd235c27ba26`
- Final status: `canceled`
- Verified in the dashboard UI:
  - selected order card transitioned from `SUBMITTED` to `CANCELED`
  - replace form was visible while the order was working
  - replace form was hidden after cancel
  - orders table reflected the updated quantity and limit price before cancel

## Frontend

A lightweight dashboard UI is available at:

- `http://localhost:8000/`

Swagger remains available at:

- `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Current dashboard capabilities:

- Select broker account
- Sync account
- Sync orders
- View automatic reconciliation state for the selected account
- View account metrics
- View holdings overview and current holdings cards
- View Longbridge configuration status
- Load quick quote
- Submit `market`, `limit`, and `stop` paper orders
- Refresh, manage, replace, and cancel eligible orders from the dashboard
- View selected order details and broker status transitions
- View execution summary for the selected order
- View recent orders
- View watchlists
- View latest positions with type, market value, unrealized PnL, and weight

Frontend files:

- `src/stocks_tool/api/routes/ui.py`
- `src/stocks_tool/ui/static/app.css`
- `src/stocks_tool/ui/static/app.js`

### Recent work completed

- Added a dedicated frontend order ticket and selected-order workflow.
- Added order-level dashboard controls for refresh, replace, and cancel.
- Added holdings summary tiles and current holdings cards above the detailed positions table.
- Expanded the positions table to include asset type, unrealized PnL, and portfolio weight.
- Added broker-account reconciliation state persistence and a background polling scheduler.
- Added a dashboard reconciliation strip for `Auto Reconciliation`, `Account Sync`, and `Orders Sync`.
- Added execution persistence, `GET /executions`, and selected-order fill summary rendering.
- Added Alembic migration `20260522_0003_execution_ledger`.
- Productized the regression scripts with a unified `scripts/run_regression.py` entrypoint, shared JSON report envelope, and optional `--json-output`.
- Updated the mock dashboard backend to expose reconciliation/account metadata and `GET /executions` so the mock workflow matches the current dashboard data surface.
- Added `tests/test_orders_api.py` for submit / replace / cancel route coverage.
- Added `tests/test_executions_api.py` for execution route coverage.
- Added `tests/test_ui_dashboard.py` to check the dashboard HTML for order-ticket and holdings sections.
- Added `tests/test_reconciliation_services.py` for sync-state success/failure transitions.
- Latest local test run after these UI additions:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

- Result: `11 passed`

## Known cleanup items

- Watchlists contain duplicate and test residue data from manual API exercises.
- `artifacts/` contains temporary screenshots from manual UI regression.
- There is no websocket push reconciliation yet.
- There is no automated browser regression yet for the cancel-confirmation flow.

## Recommended next steps

1. Clean up test watchlist data and temporary regression artifacts if they are no longer needed.
2. Add an automated browser regression for submit -> replace -> cancel plus filled-order execution summary.
3. Expand the execution ledger from per-order summary snapshots into broker-native per-fill records when the Longbridge adapter path is confirmed.
4. Expand into journal and review workflows.
